## How my website's built

1. My website is built by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    - I write my own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. I break down into multiple css and JavaScript files to maintain. This is how they are called in porfolio.html:

    ``` bash
        agirayen.github.io/
        ├─ css/
        │  ├─ style.css
        ├─ js/
        │  ├─ script.js
        ├─ img/
        │  ├─ agi-profile.jpg
        │  ├─ agi-profile.jpg  
        ├─ docs/
        │  ├─ agi-resume.pdf
        ├─ index.html
    ```
