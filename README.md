## How my website's built

1. My website is built by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    - I write my own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. I created single css and JavaScript files to maintain. This is how they are called in index.html:

    ``` bash
        agirayen.github.io/
        ├─ css/
        │  ├─ style.css
        ├─ js/
        │  ├─ script.js
        ├─ img/
        │  ├─ agi-profile.jpg
        │  ├─ scroll-up.jpg  
        ├─ index.html
    ```
    

   Besides, I also use fontawesome

   This is how I call in my index.html
    <link rel="stylesheet"
    href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free@5.15.4/css/fontawesome.min.css
    rel="stylesheet" />

    
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.4/css/all.min.css"
    />

    Also I used 
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
